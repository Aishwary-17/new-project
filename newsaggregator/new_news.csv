0,top_stories,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:05:22 GMT","NEW DELHI: India's economic growth rebounded in the three months ending in September, halting a five-quarter slide as businesses started to overcome teething troubles after the bumpy launch of a national sales tax.  Data released on Thursday showing the growth could help Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been facing criticism over the hasty July launch of a goods and services tax (GST).  The tax was aimed at transforming India's 29 states into a single customs union but it has hit millions of small businesses due to complex rules and technical glitches.  ""Upbeat corporate earnings results have been reflected in the manufacturing sector,"" said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank.  The manufacturing sector grew at 7 per cent in the September quarter compared with 1.2 per cent the previous quarter, the data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed.  The economy has broadly moved past the disruptions encountered after a shock ban on high-value banknotes in November 2016, economists said.  Gross domestic product grew 6.3 per cent in July-September, its fastest pace in three quarters, compared with 7.5 per cent a year earlier, the data showed.  Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast annual growth of 6.4 per cent in the quarter.  Economic growth picked up from 5.7 per cent in April-June, but lagged China's 6.8 per cent and Philippines' 6.9 per cent for the three months through September.  In July-September, auto sales, manufacturing, construction, electricity generation grew more quickly than in the previous quarter.  Annual growth in consumer spending, which powers more than half of the $2.3 trillion economy, slowed to 1.5 per cent in the September quarter from 6.7 per cent in the previous quarter.  Government spending slowed in the quarter, growing 1.3 per cent year-on-year compared with a near 17.2 per cent year-on-year growth in the June quarter.  On Nov. 17, Moody's upgraded India's sovereign credit rating for the first time in nearly 14 years, saying continued progress on economic and institutional reforms would boost its growth potential.  The agency expects the economy to grow 6.7 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31, and 7.5 per cent the following year.

1,top_stories,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 10:42:43 GMT","“The Market, unlike the Lord, does not forgive those who don’t know what they do”- Warren Buffett  There have been these WhatsApp messages floating around, saying that “If you bought bitcoin worth Rs 1 Lakh on January 1, 2013, it would be worth Rs 8 crore today.”  Wonderful! But if you didn’t understand what bitcoin was on January 1, 2013 and you still don’t understand what it is, would that gain have any meaning? Would you still be able to justify why you kept holding on to it apart from just dumb luck?  A lot of times we get a sense that all our neighbours are getting richer and we are being left behind. In market parlance, it’s called FOMO – fear of missing out. We sometimes deal with this by asking why, instead of what has that person figured out to become richer than us.  This, perhaps, comes from the fact that we perceive that person to be our peer in circumstances but this sudden change of fortune leaves us pondering over our personal status. To paraphrase a dialog from my favourite film Three Idiots, which captures this feeling very well – “When a friend fails in exam, you feel bad, but when a friend comes first in the same exam, you feel worse.”  Religious scriptures define the sins that hold a man back from living a virtuous life. Among these, envy is the most curious one. All the other sins allow us some level of pleasure, no matter how momentary. Envy is the only sin that doesn’t lead to any enjoyment while we are committing it.  It becomes a fruitless endeavour to compare our situation with that of others who come from a different background and knowledge. Allowing luck to distort our view of the world and just because someone had more of something we always longed for is a sure way to feel permanently disgruntled.  Does it have a cure? Envy has an easy cure. Knowing where we come from goes a long way in understanding what we may be able to achieve. Of course luck can help along the way, but figuring out what we can know, can understand and then act on it will lead to far less envy than in any other case.  Also it helps a lot if we do not keep looking over our fences into how well our neighbours are doing. Just like we may not pity them if they were less fortunate than us, we can also avoid feeling envious in case they do better than us.  We mostly hear only of the positive cases because of sheer survival of the winners. Since no one particularly enjoys talking about their losses or defeats, we are blissfully unaware of the pitfalls some people have fallen into.  Envy, after all, is not a sign of weakness but a sign of empathy working against us.  Transactions happen in the market because there’s a difference of opinion about the value of a security. If opinions occasionally tilt significantly in one direction some people who participated feel enriched and the rest who didn’t participate feel left out. It’s how markets have functioned since the time they’ve been around. We don’t need to unduly beat ourselves up just because someone did better than us. To avoid Market Envy, we should endeavour not to follow this famous quote: “Envy is the art of counting the other fellow’s blessings, instead of our own”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com,Have you been googling Bitcoin? You may be suffering from FOMO
2,top_stories,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 10:10:23 GMT","It is clear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants homes to be more affordable for the masses. The real estate sector has been under his hard gaze as is evident from the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) which came into force a few months ago.  Modi is tightening his grip on the real estate sector. A magnet for black money, real estate sector is, however, not exactly consumer-friendly, especially for the middle-class buyers. Homebuyers have been at the mercy of builders that often delay deliveries and overcharge.  One more regulation the government is planning to bring will discipline the profit-seekers who have kept the prices high in this essential sector. Unrealistically high home prices might come down if a revenue department proposal gets implemented. It plans to asks builders to pay taxes on their unsold stock of ready houses.  On the basis of a court order, which held that ready unsold flats held by builders as stock-in-trade are liable to be taxed as ""income from house property"" even if they are not rented out, the income tax department last week suggested the finance ministry that this was one way of garnering more taxes.  Real estate companies show their finished apartments as stock-in-trade and income from these are shown as business income, as in most other businesses. In a rising market, several developers hold apartments to benefit from the price appreciation that will accrue a few years after the project is complete.  With the new regulation, builders will have to either sell these properties soon, perhaps by offering discounts, or get into expensive litigation.  According to Liases Foras, the unsold inventory including properties that are under construction and completed has risen further from 734 million sq ft or about 734,000 apartments at the end of March to 765 million sq ft or about 760,000 apartments at the end of June.  Since many builders do not bring down prices according to the expectations of the consumers but would rather hold the inventory, a large number of middle-class home buyers are at the risk of 'missing the bus', or being priced out of the market. The Modi government's proactive approach on the real estate sector is expected to bring relief to such home buyers.  Another move which is being considered by the government is linking of property with Aadhaar. This will not only bring transparency to the sector which is the first and last resort of black money but also soften home prices. Union Housing Minister Hardeep Puri recently indicated that Aadhaar linkage with property transactions would be made mandatory.  Speaking to Nayantara Rai of ET NOW, Puri said such a move would go a long way in sucking out black money from real estate and also help in crackdown on benami properties. ""Seeding Aadhaar to property transaction is a great idea but I’m not going to make an announcement on that. We are already linking Aadhaar to bank accounts, etc, and we can take some additional steps for property market also,” he said.  Those who buy property to hoard black money jack up prices for end consumers. The Aadhaar linkage will hit at benami property and drive out black money from real estate, also making home prices affordable for end buyers.

3,top_stories,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 09:46:22 GMT","India's fiscal deficit at the end of October hit 96.1 per cent of the budget estimate for 2017- 18, mainly due to lower revenue realisation and rise in expenditure.  In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit -- the difference between expenditure and revenue -- was Rs 5.25 lakh crore during April-October of 2017-18, according to data of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA).  During the same period of 2016-17, the deficit stood at 79.3 per cent of the target.  For 2017-18, the government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.2 per cent of GDP.

""We keep hearing of the 'wait-and-watch' or 'fence-sitting' syndrome on the residential property market, which basically means that a significant number of people who want to buy a home are not doing so for various reasons, including expectation of price correction, lower interest rates, among others,"" Anarock Property Consultants CEO Ashwinder Raj Singh said.  It is frequently said that buyers may also be waiting for lower interest rates on home loans, especially in the affordable housing segment, he noted.  ""However, lower interest rates alone are not a sufficiently compelling rationale for aspiring mid-range housing buyers to abandon their 'wait-and-watch' mode.  ""If, however, the lower interest rates coincide with a hard discount or some other money-saving offer, many people will certainly come onto the market with a firm intention to finally buy a home,"" Singh said.  As long as unofficial discounts to serious buyers serve the purpose, it is unlikely that there will be an official correction of prices, he said.  ""In other words, it is unwise to wait for a formal price correction, since prices may not reduce and could even increase in certain locations and projects,"" Singh said. ""The best course of action for 'fence-sitting' buyers today is to short-list the properties they are interested in, ensure that they are RERA-compliant, negotiate the best possible deal with the developer and go in for purchase,"" he added.

The bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, said that Rs 20 crore has been deposited with the apex court registry by the prominent real estate firm and the money would be used in paying back the principal amount to the home buyers who have received nothing in refund. It also asked Amicus Curiae Agarawal to assist in disbursal.  The court said the issue of interest and the deduction of return on investment (RoI) from the principal, payable to home buyers, would be dealt with at later stage.  Advocates Akhilesh Kumar Pandey and Shoeb Alam, appearing for some home buyers, said the interest of the hassled home buyers needed to be protected.  The bench, which had asked the amicus curiae to set up a web portal to deal with grievances of home buyers on September 22, said that Rs two lakh be paid to him towards expenses incurred in setting up of the portal.  It posted for December 4 the final disposal of appeals of Supertech filed against the Allahabad High Court's April 11, 2014 verdict ordering demolition of the twin towers--Apex and Ceyane-- and directing the realty major to refund money to home buyers with 14 per cent interest in three months.  Earlier, the top court had asked the home buyers to register and lodge their grievances on the web portal set up by the amicus curiae.  It had asked the amicus curiae to include in the web portal the entire details of home buyers of these twin towers and the money paid by them and refunds made by the firm.  The real estate firm had said it had deposited Rs 20 crore with the apex court registry for refunding money to the home buyers who did not want flats.  The apex court, on August 14, had asked Supertech to deposit Rs 10 crore for refunding money to the investors who wanted to opt out of its Emerald Towers project, which comprises two 40-storey residential buildings in Noida.  Prior to this, it had said that if the two residential buildings in Noida were constructed without proper sanction, these would be ""demolished"".  The High Court's verdict had come on the plea of some residents of other buildings who had alleged that the twin towers were constructed on a green area. The towers have 857 apartments, of which about 600 flats have already been sold.  The counsel for Noida authority had earlier told the bench that the sanctioned plan for the building was in accordance with the guidelines and it was aggrieved by the high court's finding in this regard.

As part of this, the Godrej group company is get into premium kitchen appliances, large capacity refrigerators and front-loading washing machines while premiumising its air-conditioners and microwave ovens, said business head Kamal Nandi.  It is commissioning a new Rs 200 crore plant in Pune to manufacture the premium range, as Nandi said Godrej will be the first company to domestically manufacture large capacity appliances which are all currently imported.  “The premium product market may be small, but it is growing at a high pace for the past 3-5 years. It will be difficult to be amongst the top three brands in India without a presence in the premium segment which also helps to build the brand imagery,” said Nandi.  Godrej Appliances had clocked a revenue of Rs 3,300 crore in the fiscal ending March 2017 which it wants to grow to more than Rs 6,000 crore by 2020 with half of the revenue generated from premium products. The company will next year launch refrigerators with multiple doors in 500-litre plus capacity and front-loading washing machines for which it has entered into a product development partnership with an overseas company.  Nandi said the company is premiumising even mass segment products such as using steel drums in semi-automatic washing machines which are used mostly in front-loading. “We had a minimal presence in retail chains which will be beefed up since most of the premium products are sold through them. While retail chains account for 12% of total industry sales, its just 4% for us,” he said.  Godrej is the fourth largest player in refrigerators after LG, Samsung and Whirlpool with 14% share. It has 10% share in washing machines but is the second largest in semi-automatic washing machine after LG with 15% share; it has 5% share in air-conditioners and 4% in microwave ovens.

12,top_stories,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 02:10:48 GMT","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: The battle between Amazon India and Flipkart has moved to campuses, with early hiring trends suggesting a head start for the US company.  Amazon is powering ahead to become the largest ecommerce recruiter in India in terms of intake, salaries, variety of roles offered and even student interest, according to initial placement data at leading engineering colleges and business schools — among the most important talent-hunting grounds for companies.  Recruitments by Amazon have risen 25% over last year and it’s visiting more than 50 engineering campuses and 40 B-schools, the company told ET.  “Amazon’s presence in India has grown significantly over the past few years and the hiring numbers are keeping pace accordingly,” a spokesperson said in an email. Amazon does not reveal recruitment figures.  By contrast, Flipkart is back on campuses after skipping placement seasons at the Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management (IITs, IIMs) for the class of 2017 and its numbers are much lower than its rival so far.    Campus officials also said perceptions of Flipkart were affected by the company delaying joining dates for recruits from the batch of 2016. Recruitments are currently on for those finishing next year.  “There is still some hesitation among students about opting for Flipkart,” said a placement team member at IIM-Bangalore, where Amazon made 27 offers during summer placements compared with five by Flipkart. “We have spoken to the company on this issue and that has instilled some confidence among students.”  Flipkart used to be among the most high-profile recruiters, hiring 200-250 students from IITs and IIMs each year. Although it raised over $4 billion this year, the homegrown online retailer appears to be going slow compared with Amazon, based on data from leading B-schools and non-IIT engineering institutes. A Flipkart spokesperson said the company would not comment on the matter.  During final placements at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Flipkart made five offers at the Goa campus. Amazon made 14 across the Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad campuses. The annual salary offered at BITS by Amazon was Rs 27.8 lakh, while that of Flipkart was Rs 23.8 lakh.  The trend was evident at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. “Flipkart did not visit this year. Amazon has been a regular visitor at NITT. This year, it made 11offers, compared with nine offers last year,” said AK Bakthavatsalam, head of training and placement at the institute.  There could be other factors at play. Flipkart may be changing strategy and opting for more lateral hires instead of campus recruitments, said Anil Kumar, CEO of market research and advisory firm RedSeer Consulting. “Otherwise, from the growth perspective, the two companies’ manpower requirements wouldn’t be too different,” said Kumar. He said Amazon was likely to give students options to eventually move into global roles.  “The runway for students is much better at Amazon,” he added.  Campus officials said Amazon offered a greater variety of roles than Flipkart, with positions across product management, operations, category management and sales, among others.  “Hiring appetite has grown for tech as well as non-tech roles,” said the Amazon spokesperson. “We see growth across levels as per our talent requirements. Also, in our experience, interns do extremely well when they return to join us for full-time roles. Our focus will be to continue building on the internship pipeline, too.”  Amazon has invested heavily in its Indian marketplace since launching operations in the country in 2013, the most recent being an infusion of Rs 2,900 crore earlier this month.
